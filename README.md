# Titanic-EDA-analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python, focusing on data cleaning, feature engineering, and survival insights through visualizations.

## Steps
- Filled missing `Age` values with mean
- Dropped `Cabin` column
- Created `FamilySize` and `AgeGroup` features
- Analyzed survival by age group, embarkation port, and family size
- Visualized age distribution, correlation heatmap, and survival trends

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Children had higher survival rates
- Small families survived more
- Certain embarkation ports showed better survival

## Outcome
Developed strong EDA, data cleaning, and visualization skills.
